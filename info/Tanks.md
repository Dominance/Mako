Because our energy system is special type of corrosive corrupted fluid (Think lava powering a tinkers smelter.), It will require special tanks that can hold it. So far the idea is to have 3 tiers of tanks. 1 common single block tank that can hold a single type small amount of mako. Two multiblock tanks, One version that is just a common normal hold X amount of mako in larger quantities in the same space as X amount of single block tanks stacked together. The largest and last tiered tank would be able to hold four types of mako, one input / output per side. This tank would require some sort of magical device that adds something similar to compression. (think draconic evolutions RF storage) If the device malfunctions or runs out of energy the tank will slowly start to crack buckle and eventually burst open spewing corrupted fluids all over the place. Remember that if two types of mako touch each other in the world it can cause explosions as well. (Water + lava = obsidian in our case mako + mako = tnt) If we want to expand upon this idea and make the energy system a challenge we could require all the pipes and tanks variants be reinforced (gregtech multiblock upkeep is a good example) after X amount of time due to natural corruption. almost as if nothing can truly hold it forever.
